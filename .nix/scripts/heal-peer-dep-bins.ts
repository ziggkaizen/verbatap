/**
 * Heal missing `.bin/<peer>` symlinks produced by bun's isolated installer.
 *
 * ## The bug
 *
 * Bun's `--linker=isolated` installer creates `.bin/<name>` symlinks inside
 * each package's private node_modules/.bin/ for every dependency that has a
 * `bin` field in its manifest — regular, optional, AND peer dependencies all
 * go through the same code path (`Installer.zig::linkDependencyBins`), and
 * the decision to link is made purely on whether the source file exists on
 * disk at the moment the linker looks (`bin.zig`:
 *
 *     if (!bun.sys.exists(abs_target)) {
 *         this.skipped_due_to_missing_bin = true;
 *         return;
 *     }
 *
 * ). For most dependencies the installer blocks the consuming package on the
 * provider via `isTaskBlocked`, so by the time `linkDependencyBins` runs for
 * package A the provider's file is guaranteed to be in place. But for
 * circular peer dependency pairs — A declares B as a peer, B (transitively)
 * depends on A — that blocking would deadlock, so bun's `Store.isCycle`
 * detector explicitly bypasses it and lets both sides run in parallel.
 *
 * The consequence is a plain timing race between two worker threads. Which
 * side wins depends on anything that shifts the relative scheduling of the
 * two workers — CPU load, thread-pool size, filesystem write latency and
 * caching, the kernel scheduler, NICE / cgroup limits — so the same bun
 * version with the same bun.lock and the same install flags can produce
 * different `.bin/` sets not just between different hosts but in principle
 * between two consecutive runs on the same host. In practice we have
 * observed divergence between a local NixOS sandbox, a GitHub Actions
 * ubuntu-latest runner, and a GitHub Actions macos-latest runner, which is
 * enough to break any single-hash FOD.
 *
 * Concretely, the VerbaTap install hits this with
 *   - update-browserslist-db/.bin/browserslist (update-browserslist-db
 *     declares browserslist as a peer, browserslist has
 *     update-browserslist-db in its regular dependencies → cycle), and
 *   - @eslint-community/eslint-utils/.bin/eslint (eslint has eslint-utils
 *     as a regular dep, eslint-utils declares eslint as a peer → cycle).
 *
 * There is no bun configuration flag or env var that makes the outcome
 * deterministic, and no upstream issue yet tracks this specific symptom
 * (oven-sh/bun#28147 is the closest family match, different project). See
 * the header of `canonicalize-node-modules.ts` for our sibling normalization
 * pass that rebuilds `.bun/node_modules/` in sorted order.
 *
 * ## The fix this script applies
 *
 * For every package under `node_modules/.bun/` we walk its declared
 * `peerDependencies`, find each resolved peer inside the package's private
 * `node_modules/`, and create any `.bin/<name> → ../<peerName>/<path>`
 * symlinks that bun's installer "intended" to create but may have skipped.
 * Entries that already exist are left alone (the script is idempotent).
 *
 * This is the "fix by adding" approach — we produce the complete `.bin/`
 * set that bun would have produced without the race, rather than stripping
 * the inconsistent subset. Advantages:
 *
 *   - Matches bun's intended behavior; if bun ever fixes the race upstream,
 *     this script becomes a no-op (every entry it would add already exists)
 *     and the FOD hash is unchanged.
 *   - Preserves `.bin/` entries that real code might depend on. We don't
 *     rely on the (true but brittle) argument that peer-dep `.bin/` entries
 *     are dead code in Tauri apps.
 *   - Easy to explain in review: we're patching a known upstream race bug
 *     with the exact output the upstream code is trying to produce.
